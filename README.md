## Client-Side Public Links

Adzerk publishes the client-side JavaScript Decision SDK using the [UNPKG](https://unpkg.com/) delivery network. Each time we publish a new version of the SDK to NPM the following links are updated. These links are suitable for use in HTML `<script>` tags.

Using a fixed version:

- https://unpkg.com/@adzerk/decision-sdk@1.0.0-alpha.1/dist/adzerk-decision-sdk.js

Using a "bare" file path will always fetch the latest version:

- https://unpkg.com/@adzerk/decision-sdk/dist/adzerk-decision-sdk.js

Additionally, you can see the contents of the NPM package and the currently published versions by following this link in your browser:

- https://unpkg.com/browse/@adzerk/decision-sdk/
